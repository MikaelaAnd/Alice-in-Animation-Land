# Alice in Animation Land
We have created a website with visual animations, both 2D and 3D. The website's purpose was to help us learn how to make 3D animations and get a deeper insight into 2D animations. We decided on Disney’s Alice in Wonderland as a theme because the characters, the world, and the story allowed us to truly express our creativity.
